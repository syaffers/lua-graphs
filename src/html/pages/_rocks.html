        Bubble Plot of All LuaRocks

      <p><strong>Nodes/Bubbles:</strong></p>
      <p>Nodes/bubbles represent aa LuaRock and the size is relative to the
        amount of total downloads of the rock. Hovering over the bubbles show
        the value of downloads and the uploader made by the uploader. The color
        of the bubbles are grouped by uploader but since there are only so many
        colors (20 specifically), some colors represent 1 or more uploaders.
