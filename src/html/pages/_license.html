        Graph of the Top 50 Most Depended-on Lua Libraries
        <small>and its dependencies</small>
      </h1>
      <p><strong>Nodes and Edges (Ovals and Arrows):</strong></p>
      <p>Nodes represent a package and a directed edge (arrow) points to the
        package on which it depends. Green and light yellow nodes are
        packages belonging to the &quot;Top 50&quot; list, bright yellow
        nodes are packages not in the &quot;Top 50&quot; but are
        dependencies of packages in the &quot;Top 50&quot;.
      </p>
      <p>Initially, I collected 1122 packages (in July 2016) which is
        just too big to visualize efficiently (but not impossible, I could
        safely generate a graph of Top 500 nodes but displaying it becomes
        a problem). To wrap your head around the figures: the table below
        shows the number of dependents which is number of arrows pointing to
        that particular node. The &quot;Top 50&quot; is much more feasible
        to display and shows enough information dependency strategies when
        developing packages for Lua. The values below are based on the
        listed dependencies on
        <a href="http://www.luarocks.org">luarocks.org</a>. Scroll your mouse
        over the graphs to zoom in.
